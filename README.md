# 👋 Hey there, I'm Pramit Ghose (aka KAAMI777)

I’m a backend-focused full-stack developer who loves designing scalable systems and turning real-world problems into practical software solutions. From building real-time services to threading-based ML integrations, I enjoy mixing clean architecture with performance engineering.

## 🧠 Highlight Projects

### 📦 CARE_BRIDGE (Product in Progress)
> 💡 A backend-first product where users can request food or medicine support in emergencies, and are matched to **volunteers** or **medical orgs** like NZO via real-time services.

- 🔁 RESTful + WebSocket-based request system
- 🧩 Volunteer & medical provider routing
- 🧠 Role-based access control (JWT)
- 📥 Request queue system for pending help
- 💬 Status notifications and live updates
- 🐳 Docker + Postgres + FastAPI stack
- 🧵 Will include background tasks & chat support soon

---

### 🌍 Translation Service
> Powered by third-party AI APIs (e.g., Gemini), translates multilingual input text into English

- 🔗 FastAPI + Gemini API integration  
- 🧪 Clean and testable endpoints  
- 💬 Returns language name, confidence, and translated text

---

### 📈 Sentiment Analyzer
> Uses ML to classify text sentiment (positive/negative) and runs ML model in threadpool

- 🧠 Scikit-learn model via `semaphore` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`  
- 🔒 JWT protected API endpoints  
- 🪶 Lightweight and responsive for production use

---

### 📡 One-to-One Chat via WebSockets
> A custom WebSocket-based implementation for secure one-to-one messaging

- 🔐 User-authenticated socket connection  
- 🔁 Automatic reconnection and status sync  
- 🔧 Connection manager for live-user mapping

---

### 🌤️ Weather Service (Caching via Redis)
> Fetches live weather info using a third-party weather API and caches responses in Redis

- 🧠 Redis + TTL for efficient response reuse  
- 🌎 Location-based weather data  
- 🧹 Auto-invalidates old entries

---

## 🛠️ Other Work & Micro-Projects

- 🧮 **Student Information System** (Python, Tkinter, MySQL)
  - Semester marks, attendance, registration system with admin-student role separation
- 📤 **Secure File Uploader**
