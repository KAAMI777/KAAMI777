# 👋 Hey there, I'm Pramit Ghose (aka KAAMI777)

I’m a **backend-focused full-stack developer** passionate about building **scalable systems** and **real-time services**. From threading-based ML integrations to clean REST APIs, I aim to design software that’s **performant, maintainable, and solves real-world problems**.

## 🧠 Highlight Projects

### 📦 CARE_BRIDGE (In Progress)
> A backend-first product where users can **request food/medicine support during emergencies**, matched to **volunteers or medical organizations** (e.g., NZO) in real time.

- RESTful + WebSocket-based help request system  
- **Role-based access control** for users, volunteers, and medical providers  
- Real-time status notifications and queueing  
- **Dockerized** stack: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis  
- Future: In-app chat, AI-driven matching, analytics dashboards  

---

### 🌍 Translation Service
> AI-powered multilingual translation service using third-party APIs (Gemini).

- FastAPI + Gemini API integration  
- Returns language detection + confidence + translated output  
- Modular and easy to extend  

---

### 📈 Sentiment Analyzer
> Text classification using **Scikit-learn**, served via API.

- Threaded execution using `ThreadPoolExecutor` & `semaphore`  
- JWT-protected endpoints  
- Lightweight and production-ready  

---

### 📡 One-to-One Chat Service
> A **custom WebSocket implementation** for secure **1-to-1 communication**.

- User-authenticated WebSocket connections  
- Connection manager for live mapping  
- Auto-reconnect and status synchronization  

---

### 🌤️ Weather Service with Caching
> Live weather data fetcher with **Redis caching**.

- TTL-based Redis cache  
- Automatic invalidation for stale entries  
- Location-based weather lookup  

---

### 🧮 Student Information System  
> Built with **FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + MySQL** for **student registration, attendance, marks & role-based access**.

**Features (based on CRUD functions):**
- **Teachers** can:
  - Create, update, and delete students  
  - Add holistic evaluations (creativity, collaboration, engagement, health BMI, etc.)  
- **Students** can:
  - View personal details & marks  
- **JWT Authentication** for role-based operations  

---

### 🤝 Hackathon Project — Code for Good (J.P. Morgan Chase, Hyderabad)
> **Collaborated for Diksha Foundation (NGO)** to build a **holistic student evaluation platform**.

- CRUD operations for **student management** & **holistic evaluations**  
- **Role-based** teacher-student dashboard  
- Used **FastAPI + PostgreSQL + JWT**  
- Delivered a functional proof-of-concept within hackathon constraints  

---

## 🛠️ Other Micro-Projects

- **Secure File Uploader** – FastAPI + S3 + JWT  
- **AI Chatbot Prototype** – Prompt chaining via Gemini API
